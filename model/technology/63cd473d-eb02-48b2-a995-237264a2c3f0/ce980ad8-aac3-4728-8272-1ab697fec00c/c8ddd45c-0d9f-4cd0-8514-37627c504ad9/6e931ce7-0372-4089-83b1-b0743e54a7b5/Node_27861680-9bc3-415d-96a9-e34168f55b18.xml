    documentation="The Spectrograph Observatory Operations Data Service node has sufficent disk to buffer data acquired by the spectrograph. The buffer ingests data at the maximum data rate supported by the spectrograph archiver, while sustaining access needed by observing operations and ingesting into the Data Backbone proper.&#xA;&#xA;Data Achiving cannot proceed if the Observing Operations node is down, not can the operations supported by buffer continue if the Observing Operations node is down. &#xA;&#xA;The buffer is capacious enough to allow for spectrograph archiving to continue over the longest period of planned outage of the Data Backbone raw data ingest point. The buffer is also large enough to hold recently acquired data for use by observing operations.">
